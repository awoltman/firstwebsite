I am Andrew Woltman. I am a 3rd year undergrad in electrical engineering. The last two
years I was part of  the Varsity Men's Volleyball team were I tallied over 800 assists.
This year I have also joined the Varsity Men's Tennis Team here at Illinois Tech.
I enjoy long bike rides and kayaking. I also love being out in nature and taking
pictures of God's Masterpiece(nature).

This summer I had the opportunity to work for Manitowoc Ice, a Welbilt Brand, they are
the worlds largest producer of ice machines. I was able to narrow what I want to do when
I graduate through this experience. I want to become a Electrical Engineer with an
emphasis in Control Engineering.
