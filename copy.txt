I am Andrew Woltman. I am a 3rd year undergrad in electrical engineering. The last two
years I was part of  the Varsity Men's Volleyball team were I tallied over 800 assists.
This year I have also joined the Varsity Men's Tennis Team here at Illinois Tech.
I enjoy long bike rides and kayaking. I also love being out in nature and taking
pictures of God's Masterpiece(nature).

This summer I had the opportunity to work for Manitowoc Ice, a Welbilt Brand, they are
the worlds largest producer of ice machines. This summer I to projects, of them I am 
most proud two of them, working to impliment 14 languages on a newly implimented touch 
screen and working with supliers to fix a problem that was costing the company tens of 
thousands of dollars in Warrenty payout. For the languages I was a member of a team 
were we worked with our suplier for embeded controls to pick a processor that would be 
able to handle the implimentation of those 14 languages. Early on in the summmer we 
were able to determine that current processor would not allow for the expantion for 14 
languages. Upon finding this out, we worked to minimize the number of machines to enter 
the market.

The other project, we'll call it the Warrenty problem, was a problem that I got to lead.
It was a great experience that I was able to have. Haveing never had to talk to a 
suplier that was not providing us with a product that was to the design standards that we 
provided when the initial design for this product began. Using Warrenty data we were able
provide them with data and a Weibull test showing that the life of the product they were 
suplying was failing more than two years before the Warrenty was up. We sent them samples
so they could do root cause analysis. They found this problem to be very concerning and 
requested to come out to Wisconsin to visit and for over some of the verification things 
they did at there labs in Idaho.
