    <h1> Andrew Woltman </h1>
    <p>
  I am Andrew Woltman. I am a 3rd year undergrad in electrical engineering. The last two
  years I was part of  the Varsity Men's Volleyball team were I tallied over 800 assists.
  This year I have also joined the Varsity Men's Tennis Team here at Illinois Tech.
  I enjoy long bike rides and kayaking. I also love being out in nature and taking
  pictures of God's Masterpiece(nature).

  This summer I had the opportunity to work for Manitowoc Ice, a Welbilt Brand,

  they are the worlds largest producer of ice machines. This summer I to projects, of 
  them I am most proud two of them, working to impliment 14 languages on a newly 
  implimented touch screen and working with supliers to fix a problem that was costing 
  the company tens of thousands of dollars in Warrenty payout. For the languages I was a 
  member of a team were we worked with our suplier for embeded controls to pick a 
  processor that would be able to handle the implimentation of those 14 languages. 
  Early on in the summmer we were able to determine that current processor would not allow 
  for the expantion for 14 languages. Upon finding this out, we worked to minimize the number 
  of machines to enter the market.

  The other project, we'll call it the Warrenty problem, was a problem that I got to lead.
  It was a great experience that I was able to have. Haveing never had to talk to a 
  suplier that was not providing us with a product that was to the design standards that we 
  provided when the initial design for this product began. Using Warrenty data we were able
  provide them with data and a Weibull test showing that the life of the product they were 
  suplying was failing more than two years before the Warrenty was up. We sent them samples
  so they could do root cause analysis. They found this problem to be very concerning and 
  requested to come out to Wisconsin to visit and for over some of the verification things 
  they did at there labs in Idaho.
      </p>
    <p>
  Through this experience, I was able to narrowed what I want to do when I graduate through 
  this experience. I want to become a Electrical Engineer with an emphasis in Controls 
  Engineering. They have expressed interest in having me return next summer to contue to 
  gain experience with the company and in the industry.

  This summer was an eye openening experience and it gives me the confidence and the drive 
  to do better in school. This next semester is going to be one of my hardest semests and 
  I will have to use that to move me to do my best all the time. Through hard work and God 
  willing there will be many more opportunities to better myself and test myself while 
  while doing so! Thes next two years are going to be a ride! Let's do this!
